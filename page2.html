      The Mācuahuitl was a weapon similar in shape to a cricket bat, but along the sides shards of obsidian, sharper than modern day razors, imbedded in the side of the club.
      This makes a weapon similar in concept to a sword, hence why this is commonly called an Aztec “Sword”.<br>

      There were one handed and two handed variants of this weapon.
      There were even reports from the Spanish that this sword could cut the head of a horse off in one swing, this however is left up to debate.
