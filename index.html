      Hi, my name is David Aiden Nicolson. This is my Capstone Website.<br><br>
      To be honest I was at a complete loss about what to have this website be.<br>
      See below for a picture of me thinking about what this website would be about.<br>
      What I eventually came up with was that the pages of this website would be the blogs that I made previously,<br>
      but with some extra stuff added in. (mostly pictures)<br>
      I've been interested in Aztec history and culture for a while now, so those blogs were fun to write.<br>
